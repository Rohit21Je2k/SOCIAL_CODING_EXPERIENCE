## Built using

- Below are the technologies we have used to build our project.

- For Frontend we went with REACTJS, which is a component based library and focuses a lot on resuability of the code.

- For Backend we went NODEJS, which enabled the same developers to easily work on both the frontend and backend.

- For Database we went with mongoDB, which is a no-sql database, which provided us with flexibility in our schema as we were building the project.

- We have also deployed out app on Netlify(Frontend) and Heroku(Backend)
